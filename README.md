#Waves Simulation

##A school project of Numercal Linear Algebra applied to the simulation of a wave

As the title puts it, a engineering school first year project in matlab and Fortran, which implements matrix and singular values algorithms in order to do a physical simulation.

The only interesting addition we made was to remark that the model given for the simulation made peculiar matrix, so we could only take one out of three elements of it and have a very small error (for a way better time).
